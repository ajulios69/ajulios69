- 👋 Hi, I’m @ajulios69
- 👀 After not find a theme with the config I like in Bracket I decided to follow their instructions to create one myself
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Brackets Themes...
- 📫 How to reach me: Never been here before so don't know exactly how it works yet, so I presume this should have any kind of chat feature so in case you know how already, contact me using my user name ajulios69 ;) ...
- 😄 Pronouns: AJULIOS69 come from Alexandre JULIO da Silva 69 which is the year I was born ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm 55 and still learning new things...
